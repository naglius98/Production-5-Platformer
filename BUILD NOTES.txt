HOW TO PLAY:

The current stage is just a sandbox to show off the concept of the game. A 2D platformer based around jumping and dashing around a level, collecting collectibles to fill up a completion bar. This will need to be done while avoiding enemies. The current sandbox shows off the movement of the player and the kind of actions that are possible: moving around using WASD, sliding and walljumping off of walls and dashing through the level using the left shift.

CURRENT FEATURES:

The current features in the level are the player movement: the ability to move left and right, as well as jumping. The player also has the ability to dash using left shift, as well as chaining wall jumps and sliding down vertical walls.
